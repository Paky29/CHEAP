# CHEAP 

Software cost estimation provides the foundation for planning the
job scheduling and budget, the accuracy of an estimate can deter-
mine if the project is able to meet its objectives. However, effective
cost estimation requires a thorough understanding of the project
scope, deliverables and the effort required to develop the project,
so it is very complex. For this reason, our main goal is to develop a
machine learning model to estimate software project development
effort in order to help project manager in their job. In particular,
we intend to use a specific Ensembling method, that is Stacking,
to improve the generalization and the accuracy of the predictions
and mitigate the small size of the datasets related to the issue at
hand. Moreover, the designed model should be able to adapt to new
data, in order to provide project managers with an accurate and
reliable cost prediction system that help them efficiently planning
development activities. A comprehensive analysis of the existing
cost estimation models is finally carried out with the purpose of
assessing how competitive the proposed model could be compared
to state-of-art technologies
